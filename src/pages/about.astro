    <span>
     Hi, I'm Brinkley, the owner and sole developer of Bedford Software. I founded Bedford Software after realizing that many local small businesses
     lacked well-designed, regularly maintained websites, which are essential for establishing a strong online presence.
    </span>
    <span>
     I've been coding websites since middle school. Instead of relying on cookie-cutter templates, I take pride in handcrafting each site to perfectly
     match the unique goals and identity of the business. Whether you need a sleek landing page or a more complex platform, I focus on delivering
     clean, functional designs without the unnecessary fluff.
    </span>
    <span
     >We also understand that not every business has the budget to invest thousands upfront in a new website. That's why we offer both lump-sum and
     month-to-month pricing options. Our month-to-month plan has become a popular choice for growing businesses as it provides flexibility while still
     ensuring consistent & professional web management.
    </span>
    <span>We're passionate about helping businesses of all sizes build a digital foundation that grows with them.</span>
